discover the risk of not making the root directory of laravel project public path

Security Vulnerabilities: By default, Laravel’s public directory is meant to be the web server’s root directory. This setup ensures that sensitive files (like configuration files, environment variables, and application logic) are not accessible via the web. If you don’t set the public directory as the root, these sensitive files could be exposed, leading to potential security breaches12.

Incorrect File Access: Laravel’s structure assumes that the public directory is the entry point for web requests. If this isn’t configured correctly, you might face issues with accessing assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images, which can break the front-end of your application3.

Routing Issues: Laravel’s routing system is designed to work with the public directory as the base. Not using it can lead to routing errors and unexpected behavior in your application4.

Deployment Complications: Many hosting environments and deployment tools expect the public directory to be the web root. Deviating from this standard can complicate deployment processes and require additional configuration1.

To mitigate these risks, it’s best to configure your web server (like Apache or Nginx) to use the public directory as the root directory of your Laravel application.
