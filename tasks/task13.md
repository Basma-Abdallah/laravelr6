definition :Middleware provide a convenient mechanism for inspecting and filtering HTTP requests entering your application.
cases:1-aravel includes a middleware that verifies the user of your application is authenticated.
      2-Additional middleware can be written to perform a variety of tasks besides authentication. For example, a logging middleware might log all incoming requests to your application. 
      3- variety of middleware are included in Laravel, including middleware for authentication and CSRF protection.
      4-It's best to envision middleware as a series of "layers" HTTP requests must pass through before they hit your application. Each layer can examine the request and even reject it entirely.
      5-some middleware would perform (some task before and some task after) the request is handled by the application 
      6-Global Middleware:If you want a middleware to run during every HTTP request to your application, you may append it to the global middleware stack in your application's bootstrap/app.php file.
      7-Assigning Middleware to Routes if you would like to assign middleware to specific routes, you may invoke the middleware method when defining the route.
      You may assign multiple middleware to the route by passing an array of middleware names to the middleware method:

                    Route::get('/', function () {
                        // ...
                    })->middleware([First::class, Second::class]);
      8-Middleware Aliases
        You may assign aliases to middleware in your application's bootstrap/app.php file. Middleware aliases allow you to define a short alias for a given middleware class, which can be especially useful for middleware with long class names:

                    use App\Http\Middleware\EnsureUserIsSubscribed;
        
                    ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
                        $middleware->alias([
                            'subscribed' => EnsureUserIsSubscribed::class
                        ]);
                    })
      9-terminable Middleware
        Sometimes a middleware may need to do some work after the HTTP response has been sent to the browser. If you define a terminate method on your middleware and your web server is using FastCGI, the terminate method will automatically be called after the response is sent to the browser:The terminate method should receive both the request and the response. Once you have defined a terminable middleware, you should add it to the list of routes or global middleware in your application's bootstrap/app.php file.
