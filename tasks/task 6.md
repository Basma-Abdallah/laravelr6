PUT Method in Laravel:
The PUT method is typically employed for updating or creating a resource at a specific URL. 
One of its key attributes is its idempotent nature, which means that making multiple identical requests should yield the same outcome
as a single request. When utilizing the PUT method in Laravel, the entire resource 
must be included in the request payload, replacing the existing resource or creating a new one if it doesn't already exist.


PATCH Method in Laravel:
In contrast to PUT, the PATCH method is geared towards making partial updates to a resource. 
This means that only specific fields of the resource are modified, leaving the rest unchanged.
 The flexibility offered by PATCH makes it an ideal choice for scenarios where you only need to 
 update certain attributes of a resource without affecting others.
